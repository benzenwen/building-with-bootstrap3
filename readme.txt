Building with Bootstrap 3 lesson example code 

Uses Bootstrap 3 v3.1.1 and v3.2.0

Each directory contains the files at the beginning of the video
lesson.  The directory also may include supporting files. Most
supporting files need to be moved into the assets or dist directories,
some are provided for reference, or they may have server code that needs
to be invoked and run.

The final state of the files at the end of the lesson is in the
"finish" directory, as applicable.  For the first three major chapters
(until 03.03), copying the finish directory's files to its parent
directory will show the end state of the chapter (assuming asset and
dist changes are followed).  The fourth chapter uses Node.js servers
or a Ruby on Rails server to work.  Details are in the video
lectures. 

Enjoy!
