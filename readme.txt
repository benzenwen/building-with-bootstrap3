"Building with Bootstrap 3" lesson example code 

These lesson files are meant to be used in conjunction with the
Building with Bootstrap 3 video course (see URL below).  Each video
lesson walks through the code to teach Bootstrap concepts and
practices.

Each subdirectory contains the files at the beginning of the video
lesson.  The directory also may include supporting files. Most
supporting files need to be moved into the assets or dist directories,
while others are provided for reference.  In the latter lessons, they
may have server code that needs to be invoked and run.

The final state of the files at the end of the lesson is in the
"finish" directory, as applicable.  For the first three major chapters
(until 03.03), copying the finish directory's files to its parent
directory will show the end state of the chapter (assuming asset and
dist changes are followed).  The fourth chapter uses Node.js servers
or a Ruby on Rails server to work.  
Enjoy!
